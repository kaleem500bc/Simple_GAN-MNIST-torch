# MNIST Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

This repository contains Python code for training and using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images resembling handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

- **GAN Architecture**: The repository consists of two main components: the Generator (`netG`) and the Discriminator (`netD`). These components work together in a competitive manner during training.
- **Dataset**: It uses the MNIST dataset, containing images of handwritten digits, to train the GAN.
